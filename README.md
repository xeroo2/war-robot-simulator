üöÄ War Robot Simulator

War Robot Simulator is a turn-based robot warfare simulation built in C++.
Robots battle each other on a 2D battlefield by moving, looking around, and firing based on their abilities and strategies.

The simulation continues until either a maximum number of turns is reached or only one robot remains standing.

üìã Overview
Battlefield: 2D grid battlefield where robots move and engage in combat.

Turn-Based: Robots take turns in sequence to look, move, and fire.

Private Positions: Each robot's position is hidden from others unless revealed by "look" actions.

Robot Evolution: Robots can upgrade to stronger forms based on their combat performance.

Custom Data Structures: Linked lists and queues are implemented manually without standard libraries.

‚öôÔ∏è Features
Battlefield Display: Real-time rendering of the battlefield after each turn.

Multiple Robot Types:

RoboCop: Looks, moves, and fires at random nearby targets.

Terminator: Moves and kills by stepping on robots.

BlueThunder: Fires in a fixed clockwise pattern.

MadBot: Randomly fires at neighboring cells.

RoboTank: Randomly fires anywhere on the battlefield.

TerminatorRoboCop: Combination of movement and firing capabilities.

UltimateRobot: The most powerful robot, moving and firing multiple shots each turn.

Robot Upgrades: Robots upgrade after achieving a set number of kills.

Three Lives: Destroyed robots can re-enter the battlefield up to three times.

Action Logging: All actions and battlefield states are logged to a file.

Error Handling: Safe input handling and game flow control.

No STL Containers: Custom linked lists and queues are used for managing turns and respawns.
